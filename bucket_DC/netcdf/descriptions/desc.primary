NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and
machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access,
and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. It is also a community
standard for sharing scientific data. The Unidata Program Center
supports and maintains netCDF programming interfaces for C, C++, Java,
and Fortran. Programming interfaces are also available for Python, IDL,
MATLAB, R, Ruby, and Perl.
