Hubbub is an HTML5 compliant parsing library, written in C. It was 
developed as part of the NetSurf project and is available for use by other 
software under the MIT licence.

The HTML5 specification defines a parsing algorithm, based on the 
behaviour of mainstream browsers, which provides instructions for how to 
parse all markup, both valid and invalid. As a result, Hubbub parses web 
content well.
