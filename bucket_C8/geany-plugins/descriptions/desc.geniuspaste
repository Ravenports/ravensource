This plugin allows the user to paste code from Geany into a configured 
pastebin service. At the moment it ships with built-in support these 
pastebin services, but more can be added:

* codepad.org
* dpaste.de
* fpaste.org
* pastebin.geany.org
* paste.debian.net
* sprunge.us

GeniusPaste automatically detects the syntax of the code and pastes it 
with syntax highlighting enabled. It can also display the pasted code 
opening a new browser tab.
