Geanydoc is a plugin for the Geany IDE that allows for executing specified 
commands on the current word at the cursor position. This word is passed 
as an argument to these commands. It allows to either place output of 
these commands in geany's buffer *DOC* or just execute an external 
program. Geanydoc is intended to be used for searching documentation API 
in different sources.
