viridisLite: Colorblind-Friendly Color Maps (Lite Version)

Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with common
forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps are
also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to
black-and-white for printing. This is the 'lite' version of the 'viridis'
package that also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous
color and fill scales and can be found at &lt;<a
