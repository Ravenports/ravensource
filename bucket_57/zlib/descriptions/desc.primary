zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- 
that is, not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library
for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating system. The
zlib data format is itself portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW
compression method used in Unix compress(1) and in the GIF image format,
the compression method currently used in zlib essentially never expands
the data.  zlib's memory footprint is also independent of the input data 
and can be reduced, if necessary, at some cost in compression.
