TinyXML is a simple, small, minimal, C++ XML parser that can be easily
integrating into other programs. It reads XML and creates C++ objects
representing the XML document. The objects can be manipulated, changed,
and saved again as XML.

*Please Note* that TinyXML development has stopped and all development
has moved to TinyXML-2. TinyXML-2 is available at
https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2
