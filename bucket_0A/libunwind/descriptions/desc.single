The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C 
programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program. The 
API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved 
(callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any 
point in the call-chain (non-local goto). It supports both local 
(same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API is 
useful in a number of applications.
