Haml (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) is a layer on top of HTML or XML
that's
designed to express the structure of documents in a non-repetitive,
elegant, and
easy way by using indentation rather than closing tags and allowing Ruby
to be
embedded with ease. It was originally envisioned as a plugin for Ruby on
Rails,
but it can function as a stand-alone templating engine.
