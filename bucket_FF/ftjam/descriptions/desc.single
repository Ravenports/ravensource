Perforce JAM (short for "Just Another Make") is an open-source build tool 
that can be used as a replacement for traditional make. While it is a lot 
simpler to use it is a lot more powerful than make. "Jamfiles" are in 
general much more portable between platforms.

FTjam is an extended version of mainline Jam that aims to remain 100% 
compatible with the original. It originated within the FreeType project.
