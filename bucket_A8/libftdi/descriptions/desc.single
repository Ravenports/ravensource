libFTDI is an open source library to talk to FTDI chips:

    FT230X
    FT4232H / FT2232H
    FT232R / FT245R
    FT2232L / FT2232D / FT2232C
    FT232BM / FT245BM (and the BL/BQ variants)
    FT8U232AM / FT8U245AM

The library is linked with your program in userspace, no kernel driver required.
libFTDI works perfectly with Linux, Windows, MacOS X and BSD variants thanks to
libusb.
