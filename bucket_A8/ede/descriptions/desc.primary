EDE (The "Equinox Desktop Environment") is an extremely light-weight 
desktop environment based on the FLTK toolkit. Built to not get in the 
users way, it deliberately values pure functionality over eyecandy.

It uses a slightly modified version of the PekWM window manager. Other 
than that EDE doesn't come bundeled with a lot of default applications but 
leaves the choice to the user instead.
