Dillo aims to be a multi-platform graphical web browser that stays small, 
light-weight and fast while being extensible. The developers take 
standards compliency seriously. The browser is written in C++ and uses the 
FLTK toolkit.

Currently Dillo is lacking some features like javascript support that 
makes using modern websites impossible. Work is in progress to provide the 
missing bits in future versions, though.
