Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
specified in standard Ruby syntax.
Rake has the following features:
  * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
standard Ruby syntax.
    No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is
that a tab or a space?)
  * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
  * Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.
  * Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
file names and paths.
  * Supports parallel execution of tasks.
