Telepathy is a flexible, modular communications framework for desktop and
mobile devices that enables real-time communication via pluggable protocol
backends. Telepathy is a communications service that can be accessed by
many applications (???clients???) simultaneously. This allows any
application to access presence information, request a communication channel
(potentially handled by another client), or provide collaboration features
contact-to-contact.

This package contains the library that binds Telepathy to Glib.
