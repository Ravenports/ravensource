wv is a library which allows access to Microsoft Word files. It can load 
and parse Word 2000, 97, 95 and 6 file formats. (These are the file 
formats known internally as Word 9, 8, 7 and 6.) There is some support for 
reading earlier formats as well: Word 2 docs are converted to plaintext.

wv allows other programs access to Word documents for the purpose of 
converting them to other formats.
