covr: Test Coverage for Packages

Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally) upload the
results to a coverage service like 'Codecov' &lt;<a
href="http://codecov.io">http://codecov.io</a>&gt; or 'Coveralls' &lt;<a
href="http://coveralls.io">http://coveralls.io</a>&gt;. Code coverage is a
measure of the amount of code being exercised by a set of tests. It is an
indirect measure of test quality and completeness. This package is
compatible with any testing methodology or framework and tracks coverage of
both R code and compiled C/C++/FORTRAN code.
