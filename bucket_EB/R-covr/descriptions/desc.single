covr: Test Coverage for Packages

Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally) upload the
results to a coverage service like 'Codecov' &lt;<a
href="https://about.codecov.io"
target="_top">https://about.codecov.io</a>&gt; or 'Coveralls' &lt;<a
href="https://coveralls.io" target="_top">https://coveralls.io</a>&gt;.
Code coverage is a measure of the amount of code being exercised by a set
of tests. It is an indirect measure of test quality and completeness. This
package is compatible with any testing methodology or framework and tracks
coverage of both R code and compiled C/C++/FORTRAN code.
