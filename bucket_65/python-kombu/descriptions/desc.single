About
=====

`Kombu` is a messaging library for Python.

The aim of `Kombu` is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible by
providing an idiomatic high-level interface for the AMQ protocol, and also
provide proven and tested solutions to common messaging problems.

`AMQP`_ is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard protocol
for message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security,
for which the `RabbitMQ`_ messaging server is the most popular
implementation.

Features
========

* Allows application authors to support several message server
  solutions by using pluggable transports.

    * AMQP transport using the `py-amqp`_, `librabbitmq`_, or
`qpid-python`_ libraries.

    * High performance AMQP transport written in C - when using
`librabbitmq`_

      This is automatically enabled if librabbitmq is installed:

      ::

        $ pip install librabbitmq

    * Virtual transports makes it really easy to add support for non-AMQP
      transports. There is already built-in support for `Redis`_,
      `Amazon SQS`_, `ZooKeeper`_, `SoftLayer MQ`_ and `Pyro`_.

    * In-memory transport for unit testing.

* Supports automatic encoding, serialization and compression of message
  payloads.

* Consistent exception handling across transports.

* The ability to ensure that an operation is performed by gracefully
  handling connection and channel errors.

* Several annoyances with `amqplib`_ has been fixed, like supporting
  timeouts and the ability to wait for events on more than one channel.

* Projects already using `carrot`_ can easily be ported by using
  a compatibility layer.

For an introduction to AMQP you should read the article `Rabbits and
warrens`_,
and the `Wikipedia article about AMQP`_.
