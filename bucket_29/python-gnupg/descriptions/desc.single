This module allows easy access to GnuPG's key management, encryption and
signature functionality from Python programs, by interacting with GnuPG
through file descriptors. Input arguments are strictly checked and
sanitised, and therefore this module should be safe to use in networked
applications requiring direct user input. It is intended for use on
Windows, MacOS X, BSD, or Linux, with Python 2.6, Python 2.7, Python 3.3,
Python 3.4, or PyPy.
