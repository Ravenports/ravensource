Glib-networking contains the implementations of various GLib networking 
features that cannot be implemented directly in GLib itself because of 
their dependencies.

Currently it contains a GNUTLS-based implementation of GTlsBackend, a 
libproxy-based implementation of GProxyResolver, and a GNOME 
GProxyResolver that uses the proxy information from the GSettings schemas 
in gsettings-desktop-schemas.
