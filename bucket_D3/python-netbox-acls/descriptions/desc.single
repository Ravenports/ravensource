## Installing

For adding to a NetBox Docker setup see
[the general instructions for using netbox-docker with plugins].

You can install with pip:

```bash
pip install netbox-acls
```

or by adding to your `local_requirements.txt` or `plugin_requirements.txt`
(netbox-docker):

```bash
netbox-acls
```

## Configuration

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
 or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file :

```python
PLUGINS = [
    "netbox_acls"
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_acls": {
        "top_level_menu": True # If set to True the plugin will add a top
level menu item for the plugin. If set to False the plugin will add a menu
item under the Plugins menu item.  Default is set to True.
    },
}
```

To add the required `netbox-acls` tables to your NetBox database, run the
`migrate` manager subcommand in the NetBox virtual environment:
```
cd /opt/netbox
sudo ./venv/bin/python3 netbox/manage.py migrate
```
