The purpose of libmspack is to provide compressors and decompressors, 
archivers and dearchivers for Microsoft compression formats: CAB, CHM, 
WIM, LIT, HLP, KWAJ and SZDD. It is also designed to be easily embeddable, 
stable, robust and resource-efficient.

The library is not intended as a generalised "any archiver" interface. 
Users of the library must explicitly choose the format they intend to work 
with.
