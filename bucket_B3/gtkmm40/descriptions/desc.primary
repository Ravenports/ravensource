gtkmm is the official C++ interface for the popular GUI library GTK+.
Highlights include typesafe callbacks, and a comprehensive set of widgets
that are easily extensible via inheritance. You can create user interfaces
either in code or with the Glade User Interface designer, using
Gtk::Builder.

This is the Gtk+ 3 version.
