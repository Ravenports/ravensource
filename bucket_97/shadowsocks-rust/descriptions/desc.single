Shadowsocks is a free and open-source encryption protocol project, widely
used in China to circumvent Internet censorship. It was created in 2012 by
a Chinese programmer named "clowwindy", and multiple implementations of the
protocol have been made available since.[7][8] Shadowsocks is not a proxy
on its own, but (typically) is the client software to help connect to a
third-party SOCKS5 proxy. Once connected, internet traffic can then be
directed through the proxy.[9] Unlike an SSH tunnel, Shadowsocks can also
proxy User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic.
