The ports the crappy nodejs http_parser to the typescript language.

The http_parser project is practically unmaintainable. Even introduction
of a single new method results in a significant code churn.  This new
project aims for maintainability, benchmarking, and verification.

This project is a port of http_parser to TypeScript. llparse is used to
generate the output C source file, which could be compiled and linked
with the embedder's program (like Node.js).
