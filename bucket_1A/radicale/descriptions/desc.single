The Radicale Project is a CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contact) server.
It aims to be a light solution, easy to use, easy to install, easy to
configure.  As a consequence, it requires few software dependances and is
pre-configured to work out-of-the-box.

The Radicale Project runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux, BSD,
MacOS X) and Windows.  It is known to work with Evolution, Lightning,
iPhone and Android clients. It is free and open-source software, released under
GPL version 3.
