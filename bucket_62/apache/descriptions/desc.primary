The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful and flexible HTTP/1.1 compliant web
server.  Originally designed as a replacement for the NCSA HTTP Server, it
has grown to be the most popular web server on the Internet.  As a project
of the Apache Software Foundation, the developers aim to collaboratively
develop and maintain a robust, commercial-grade, standards-based server
with freely available source code.
