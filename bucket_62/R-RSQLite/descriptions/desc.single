RSQLite: SQLite Interface for R

Embeds the SQLite database engine in R and provides an interface compliant
with the DBI package. The source for the SQLite engine (version 3.50.3) and
for various extensions is included. System libraries will never be
consulted because this package relies on static linking for the plugins it
includes; this also ensures a consistent experience across all
installations.
