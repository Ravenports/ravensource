A fully-featured YAML 1.2 and JSON parser/writer with zero-copy operation
and no artificial limits.

libfyaml is designed for high performance with zero content duplication,
supporting arbitrarily large documents without the 1024-character limit on
implicit keys found in other parsers. It passes the complete YAML test
suite and provides both event-based (streaming) and document tree APIs for
maximum flexibility.
