LibIDL is a library for creating trees of IDL (CORBA Interface Definition 
Language) files, a specification for defining portable interfaces. 
Initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the GNOME project and primary 
means of libIDL distribution), it was actually designed to be as portable 
and reusable as possible.
