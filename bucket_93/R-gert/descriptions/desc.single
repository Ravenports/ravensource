gert: Simple Git Client for R

Simple git client for R based on 'libgit2' &lt;<a
href="https://libgit2.org" target="_top">https://libgit2.org</a>&gt; with
support for SSH and HTTPS remotes. All functions in 'gert' use basic R data
types (such as vectors and data-frames) for their arguments and return
values. User credentials are shared with command line 'git' through the
git-credential store and ssh keys stored on disk or ssh-agent.
