FreeTDS is a set of libraries for Unix and Linux that allows your
programs to natively talk to Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase databases.

Technically speaking, FreeTDS is an open source implementation of the
TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol used by these databases for their
own clients. It supports many different flavors of the protocol and
three APIs to access it. Additionally FreeTDS works with other software
such as Perl and PHP, providing access from those languages as well.
