Xdm manages a collection of X displays, which may be on the local host or 
remote servers. The design of xdm was guided by the needs of X terminals 
as well as The Open Group standard XDMCP, the X Display Manager Control 
Protocol. Xdm provides services similar to those provided by init, getty 
and login on character terminals: prompting for login name and password, 
authenticating the user, and running a "session."
