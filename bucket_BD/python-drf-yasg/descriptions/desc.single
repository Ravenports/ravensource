drf-yasg - Yet another Swagger generator
########################################

|travis| |nbsp| |codecov| |nbsp| |rtd-badge| |nbsp| |pypi-version|

Generate **real** Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 specifications from a Django Rest
Framework API.

Compatible with

- **Django Rest Framework**: 3.7.7, 3.8, 3.9
- **Django**: 1.11, 2.0, 2.1
- **Python**: 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7

Only the latest patch version of each ``major.minor`` series of Python,
Django and Django REST Framework is supported.

**Only the latest version of drf-yasg is supported.** Support of old
versions is dropped immediately with the release
of a new version. Please do not create issues before upgrading to the
latest release available at the time. Regression
reports are accepted and will be resolved with a new release as quickly as
possible. Removed features will usually go
through a deprecation cycle of a few minor releases.
