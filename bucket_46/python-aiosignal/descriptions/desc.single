Introduction
============

A project to manage callbacks in `asyncio` projects.

Signal is a list of registered asynchronous callbacks.

The signal's life-cycle has two stages: after creation its content
could be filled by using standard list operations: ``sig.append()``
etc.

After you call ``sig.freeze()`` the signal is *frozen*: adding, removing
and dropping callbacks is forbidden.

The only available operation is calling the previously registered
callbacks by using ``await sig.send(data)``.

For concrete usage examples see the `Signals
<https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web_advanced.html#aiohttp-web-signals>
section of the [Web Server Advanced
] chapter of the `aiohttp
documentation`_.
