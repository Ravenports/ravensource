This package contains a minimal seat management daemon, and a universal 
seat management library. The project currently supports Linux and FreeBSD, 
and has experimental NetBSD support.

Seat management takes care of mediating access to shared devices 
(graphics, input), without requiring the applications needing access to be 
root.
