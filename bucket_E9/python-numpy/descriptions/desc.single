NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is
a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various
derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of
routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical,
shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms,
basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and
much more.
