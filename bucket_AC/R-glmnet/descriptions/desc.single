glmnet: Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models

Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or elastic-net
regularization path for linear regression, logistic and multinomial
regression models, Poisson regression and the Cox model. Two recent
additions are the multiple-response Gaussian, and the grouped multinomial
regression. The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise
fashion, as described in the papers listed in the URL below.
