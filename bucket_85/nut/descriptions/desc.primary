The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide
support for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power
Distribution Units, Automatic Transfer Switches, Power Supply Units and
Solar Controllers. NUT provides a common protocol and set of tools to
monitor and manage such devices, and to consistently name equivalent
features and data points, across a vast range of vendor-specific protocols
and connection media types.
