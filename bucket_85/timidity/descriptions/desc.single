TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files by converting 
them into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data along with digital 
instrument data files, then it synthesizes them in real-time, and plays. 
It can not only play sounds, but also can save the generated waveforms 
into hard disks as various audio file formats.

TiMidity++ is the continuation of the old TiMidity project.
