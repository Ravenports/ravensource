This project offers you an alternative to **Universal Charset Encoding
Detector**, also known as **Chardet**.

## ⚡ Performance

This package offer better performance than its counterpart Chardet. Here
are some numbers.

| Package       | Accuracy       | Mean per file (ms) | File per sec (est)
|
| ------------- | :-------------: | :------------------: |
:------------------: |
|      [chardet]        |     86 %     |     200 ms      |       5 file/sec
       |
| charset-normalizer |    **98 %**     |     **39 ms**      |       26
file/sec    |

| Package       | 99th percentile       | 95th percentile | 50th percentile
|
| ------------- | :-------------: | :------------------: |
:------------------: |
|      [chardet]        |     1200 ms     |     287 ms      |       23 ms  
     |
| charset-normalizer |    400 ms     |     200 ms      |       15 ms    |

Chardet's performance on larger file (1MB+) are very poor. Expect huge
difference on large payload.

> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More
details on used files, see GHA workflows.
> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be
updated to include more files.
> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors
should remain the same.
> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our
is measured using Chardet initial capability
> (eg. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.

[cchardet] is a non-native (cpp binding) and unmaintained faster
alternative with 
a better accuracy than chardet but lower than this package. If speed is the
most important factor, you should try it.

## ✨ Installation

Using PyPi for latest stable
```sh
pip install charset-normalizer -U
