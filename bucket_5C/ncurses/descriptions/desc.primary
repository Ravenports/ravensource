The ncurses software includes a SVr4 and XSI-Curses compatible
curses library as well as terminfo tools including "tic", "infocmp",
and "captoinfo".  The library is used by other programs for text-mode
support of color, multiple highlights, forms-drawing characters,
automatic recognition of keypad and function-key sequences, and more.

This package contains the shared libraries.
