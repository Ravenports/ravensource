  message: <<EOM
For procedural languages and postgresql functions, please note that
you might have to update them when updating the server.

The port is set up to use autovacuum for new databases, but you might
also want to vacuum and perhaps backup your database regularly.

If you plan to access your PostgreSQL server using ODBC, please
consider running the SQL script %%PREFIX%%/share/postgresql/odbc.sql
to get the functions required for ODBC compliance.

======================================================================

Before the service can be started using

  svcadm enable postgresql

the database must be initialized.  To do that, run this command:

  sudo -u pgsql initdb -D /raven/pgsql/data

NB. Ravenports's PostgreSQL logs in two places.
    Internal messages from the database engine are sent to syslog by
    default.  See %%PREFIX%%/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf to update that
    setting.  All server output (stdin, stdout) is logged to the
    %%PREFIX/var/log/postgresql directory in a log with a name starting
    with "server".

NB. If you're not using a checksumming filesystem like ZFS, you might
    wish to enable data checksumming. It can be enabled during
    the initdb phase, by adding the "--data-checksums" flag to
    the postgresql_initdb_flags rcvar. Otherwise you can enable it later by
    using pg_checksums.  Check the initdb(1) manpage for more info
    and make sure you understand the performance implications.

======================================================================

SECURITY ADVICE

If upgrading from a version 15.x < 15.7:
A security vulnerability was found in the system views pg_stats_ext
and pg_stats_ext_exprs, potentially allowing authenticated database
users to see data they shouldn't.  If this is of concern in your
installation, run the SQL script %%DATADIR%%/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql
for each of your databases. For details, see
https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-4317/
