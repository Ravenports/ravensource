SDL_mixer is a sound mixing library that is used with the SDL library, and 
almost as portable. It allows a programmer to use multiple samples along 
with music without having to code a mixing algorithm themselves. It also 
simplyfies the handling of loading and playing samples and music from all 
sorts of file formats.
