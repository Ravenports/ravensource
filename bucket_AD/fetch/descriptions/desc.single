The fetch program is a command-line utility originating with FreeBSD.
Its purpose is to retrieve the file(s) pointed to by the URL(s) on the
command line.

The original implementation of fetch was done by Jean-Marc Zucconi
<jmz@FreeBSD.org>.  It was extensively re-worked for FreeBSD 2.2 by
Garrett Wollman <wollman@FreeBSD.org>, and later completely rewritten to
use the fetch(3) library by Dag-Erling Smorgrav <des@FreeBSD.org> and
Michael Gmelin <freebsd@grem.de>.
