The IO::String module provides the IO::File interface for in-core strings.
An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and makes it possible to
use the normal file operations for reading or writing data, as well as for
seeking to various locations of the string. This is useful when you want to
use a library module that only provides an interface to file handles on
data that you have in a string variable.
