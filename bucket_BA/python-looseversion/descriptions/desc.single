# looseversion - Version numbering for anarchists and software realists

A backwards/forwards-compatible fork of `distutils.version.LooseVersion`,
for times when PEP-440 isn't what you need.

The goal of this package is to be a drop-in replacement for the original
`LooseVersion`.
It implements an identical interface and comparison logic to
`LooseVersion`.
The only major change is that a `looseversion.LooseVersion` is comparable
to a
`distutils.version.LooseVersion`, which means tools should not need to
worry whether
all dependencies that use LooseVersion have migrated.

If you are simply comparing versions of Python packages, consider moving to
[packaging.version.Version],
which follows [PEP-440].
`LooseVersion` is better suited to interacting with heterogeneous version
schemes that
do not follow PEP-440.
