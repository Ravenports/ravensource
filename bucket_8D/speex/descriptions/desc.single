The Speex is a patent-free, Open Source/Free Software voice codec. Unlike 
other codecs like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, Speex is designed to compress voice 
at bitrates in the 2-45 kbps range. Possible applications include VoIP, 
internet audio streaming, archiving of speech data (e.g. voice mail), and 
audio books. In some sense, it is meant to be complementary to the Ogg 
Vorbis codec.
