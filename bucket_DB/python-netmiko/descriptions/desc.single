Netmiko
=======

Multi-vendor library to simplify CLI connections to network devices

<br />

## Why Netmiko?
Network automation to screen-scraping devices is primarily concerned with
gathering output from show commands and with making configuration changes.

Netmiko aims to accomplish both of these operations and to do it across a
very broad set of platforms. It seeks to do this while abstracting away
low-level state control (i.e. eliminate low-level regex pattern matching to
the extent practical).

### Getting Started:

#### Create a dictionary representing the device.

Supported device_types can be found in [ssh_dispatcher.py], see
CLASS_MAPPER keys.
```py
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

cisco_881 = {
    'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
    'host':   '10.10.10.10',
    'username': 'test',
    'password': 'password',
    'port' : 8022,          # optional, defaults to 22
    'secret': 'secret',     # optional, defaults to ''
}
