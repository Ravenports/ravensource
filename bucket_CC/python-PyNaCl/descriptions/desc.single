PyNaCl is a Python binding to `libsodium`_, which is a fork of the
`Networking and Cryptography library`_. These libraries have a stated goal
of
improving usability, security and speed. It supports Python 2.7 and 3.4+ as
well as PyPy 2.6+.

Features
--------

* Digital signatures
* Secret-key encryption
* Public-key encryption
* Hashing and message authentication
* Password based key derivation and password hashing

Installation
============

Binary wheel install
--------------------

PyNaCl ships as a binary wheel on OS X, Windows and Linux ``manylinux1``
[#many]_ ,
so all dependencies are included. Make sure you have an up-to-date pip
and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pynacl

Linux source build
------------------

PyNaCl relies on `libsodium`_, a portable C library. A copy is bundled
with PyNaCl so to install you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pynacl

If you'd prefer to use the version of ``libsodium`` provided by your
distribution, you can disable the bundled copy during install by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ SODIUM_INSTALL=system pip install pynacl

.. warning:: Usage of the legacy ``easy_install`` command provided by
setuptools
   is generally discouraged, and is completely unsupported in PyNaCl's
case.

.. _libsodium: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium

.. [#many] `manylinux1 wheels <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/>`_
    are built on a baseline linux environment based on Centos 5.11
    and should work on most x86 and x86_64 glibc based linux environments.

Changelog
=========
