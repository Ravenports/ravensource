GStreamer is not a media player. It is a library for constructing graphs 
of media-handling components, ranging from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback and 
audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear 
editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec 
and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and 
filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.
