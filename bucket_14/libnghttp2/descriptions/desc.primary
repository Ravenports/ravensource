nghttp2 is an implementation of HTTP/2 and its header compression
algorithm HPACK in C.

The framing layer of HTTP/2 is implemented as a reusable C library.  On top
of that has been implemented a HTTP/2 client, server and proxy.  A load
test and benchmarking tool for HTTP/2 and SPDY has also been developed.
