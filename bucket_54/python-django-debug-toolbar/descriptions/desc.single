The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display
various
debug information about the current request/response and when clicked,
display
more details about the panel's content.

In addition to the built-in panels, a number of third-party panels are
contributed by the community.

Django â‰¥ 4.2.0.

The Debug Toolbar has experimental support for [Django's asynchronous views
]. Please note that
the Debug Toolbar still lacks the capability for handling concurrent
requests.
