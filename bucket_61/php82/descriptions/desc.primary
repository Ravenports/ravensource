PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded
into HTML. It is modular, and object-oriented. Much of its syntax
is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in.  The language is designed to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

This package provides PHP version 8.2.x.
