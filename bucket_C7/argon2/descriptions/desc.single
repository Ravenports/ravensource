Argon2 is a password-hashing function created by by Alex Biryukov, Daniel 
Dinu, and Dmitry Khovratovich. It was declared the winner of the Password 
Hashing Competition (PHC) in 2015. The PHC recommends using it rather than 
legacy algorithms. Argon2 is in the public domain.

There are two versions of Argon2. Argon2d provides the highest resistance 
against GPU cracking attacks. Argon2i is designed to resist side-channel 
attacks. Argon2id is a hybrid that should generally be used unless special 
reasons exist to prefer one of the other versions.
