Bottle is a fast and simple micro-framework for small web applications. It
offers request dispatching (Routes) with URL parameter support, templates,
a built-in HTTP Server and adapters for many third party WSGI/HTTP-server
and
template engines - all in a single file and with no dependencies other than
the
Python Standard Library.
