Wireshark is the world's foremost and widely-used network protocol
analyzer. It lets you see what???s happening on your network at a
microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across
many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and
educational institutions. Wireshark development thrives thanks to the
volunteer contributions of networking experts around the globe and is the
continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998.

Wireshark has a rich feature set which includes the following:
 - Deep inspection of hundreds of protocols
 - Live capture and offline analysis
 - Standard three-pane packet browser
 - Multi-platform: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Solaris, BSD, and others
 - Captured network data can be browsed via a GUI, or via the TTY-mode
   TShark utility
 - The most powerful display filters in the industry
 - Rich VoIP analysis
 - Read/write many different capture file formats: tcpdump (libpcap),
   Pcap NG, Catapult DCT2000, Cisco Secure IDS iplog, Microsoft Network
   Monitor, Network General Sniffer (compressed and uncompressed),
   Sniffer Pro, and NetXray, Network Instruments Observer, NetScreen snoop,
   Novell LANalyzer, RADCOM WAN/LAN Analyzer, Shomiti/Finisar Surveyor,
   Tektronix K12xx, Visual Networks Visual UpTime,
   WildPackets EtherPeek/TokenPeek/AiroPeek, and many others
 - Capture files compressed with gzip can be decompressed on the fly
 - Live data can be read from Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP/HDLC, ATM,
   Bluetooth, USB, Token Ring, Frame Relay, FDDI, and others
 - Decryption support for many protocols, including IPsec, ISAKMP,
   Kerberos, SNMPv3, SSL/TLS, WEP, and WPA/WPA2
 - Coloring rules can be applied for quick, intuitive analysis
 - Output can be exported to XML, PostScript, CSV, or plain text
