perl-lib-abs	The main reason of this library is transformate relative paths to\nabsolute at the "BEGIN" stage, and push transformed to @INC. Relative\npath basis is not the current working directory, but the location of\nfile, where the statement is (caller file). When using common "lib",\nrelative paths stays relative to curernt working directory.
perl-Socket6	IPv6 related part of the C socket.h defines and structure manipulators\n\nFunctions supplied are:\n- inet_pton FAMILY, TEXT_ADDRESS\n- inet_ntop FAMILY, BINARY_ADDRESS\n- pack_sockaddr_in6 PORT, ADDR\n- pack_sockaddr_in6_all PORT, FLOWINFO, ADDR, SCOPEID\n- unpack_sockaddr_in6 NAME\n- unpack_sockaddr_in6_all NAME\n- gethostbyname2 HOSTNAME, FAMILY\n- getaddrinfo NODENAME, SERVICENAME, [FAMILY, SOCKTYPE, PROTOCOL, FLAGS]\n- getnameinfo NAME, [FLAGS]\n- getipnodebyname HOST, [FAMILY, FLAGS]\n- getipnodebyaddr FAMILY, ADDRESS\n- gai_strerror ERROR_NUMBER\n- in6addr_any\n- in6addr_loopback
perl-JSON-XS	This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa. Its primary goal is to be *correct* and its secondary goal is to be *fast*. To reach the latter goal it was written in C.

perl-Tk-Zinc	The Zinc widget is very similar to Tk Canvase in that it supports structured graphics. Like the Canvas, TkZinc implements items used to display graphical entities. Those items can be manipulated and bindings can be associated with them to implement interaction behaviors. But unlike the Canvas, TkZinc can structure the items in a hierarchy (with the use of group items), has support for affine 2D transforms (i.e. translation, scaling, and rotation), clipping can be set for sub-trees of the item hierarchy, the item set is quite more powerful including field specific items for Air Traffic systems and new rendering techniques such as transparency and gradients.
perl-mod_perl	This module gives you a persistent Perl interpreter embedded in your web server. This lets you avoid the overhead of starting an external interpreter and avoids the penalty of Perl start-up time, giving you super-fast dynamic content.

perl-Test-Deep	This module gives you lots of flexibility when testing deep structures.
perl-Test-Most	This module contains the most commonly needed test functions and features.
perl-File-Type	File::Type uses magic numbers (typically at the start of a file) to determine the MIME type of that file. It can use either a filename, or file contents, to determine the type of a file.
perl-IO-String	The IO::String module provides the IO::File interface for in-core strings. An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and makes it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or writing data, as well as for seeking to various locations of the string. This is useful when you want to use a library module that only provides an interface to file handles on data that you have in a string variable.
perl-Alien-HDF4	Encapsulate install info for HDF4.\nProduces config info usable via ExtUtils::Depends.
perl-Mozilla-CA	Mozilla::CA provides a copy of Mozilla's bundle of Certificate Authority\ncertificates in a form that can be consumed by modules and libraries\nbased on OpenSSL.\n\nThe module provide a single function:\n\nSSL_ca_file()\n    Returns the absolute path to the Mozilla's CA cert bundle PEM file.
perl-JSON-Parse	A module for parsing JSON. (JSON means "JavaScript Object Notation" and it\nis specified in "RFC 8259".)
perl-XML-RegExp	This package contains regular expressions for the following XML tokens: BaseChar, Ideographic, Letter, Digit, Extender, CombiningChar, NameChar, EntityRef, CharRef, Reference, Name, NmToken, and AttValue.\nThe definitions of these tokens were taken from the XML spec (Extensible Markup Language 1.0) at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.\n\nAlso contains the regular expressions for the following tokens from the XML Namespaces spec at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names: NCNameChar, NCName, QName, Prefix and LocalPart.
perl-URL-Encode	This module provides functions to encode and decode strings into and from\nthe "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" encoding.\n \nThe "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format encodes a ordered data sets\nof pairs consisting of a name and a value, with pairs seperated by\nampersand or semicolon and names and values seperated by the equal sign.\nSpace characters are replaced with plus sign and any characters not in the\nunreserved character set is encoded using the percent-encoding scheme also\nused for resource identifiers. A percent-encoded octet is encoded as a\ncharacter triplet, consisting of the percent character "%" followed by the\ntwo hexadecimal digits representing that octet's numeric value.\n\nThe unreserved character set includes the uppercase and lowercase letters,\ndecimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.\n \n  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n  0123456789\n  - . _ ~
perl-Set-Scalar	The first priority of Set::Scalar is to be a convenient interface to sets (as in: unordered colletions of Perl scalars.)  While not designed to be slow or big, neither has it been designed to be fast or compact.

perl-Devel-Trace	Devel::Trace - Print out each line before it is executed (like sh -x)
perl-libxml-perl	libxml-perl is a collection of smaller Perl modules, scripts, and documents\nfor working with XML in Perl.  libxml-perl software works in combination\nwith XML::Parser, PerlSAX, XML::DOM, XML::Grove and others.
perl-String-Util	String::Util provides a collection of small, handy functions for\nprocessing strings in various ways.
perl-Regexp-IPv6	Support regular expression for IPv6 addresses.
perl-Time-timegm	The POSIX standard provides three functions for converting between integer\nepoch values and 6-component "broken-down" time representations. localtime\nand gmtime convert an epoch into the 6 components of seconds, minutes,\nhours, day of month, month and year, in either local timezone or UTC. The\nmktime function converts a local broken-down time into an epoch value.\nHowever, POSIX does not provide a UTC version of this.\n\nThis module provides a function timegm which has this ability.
perl-Config-JFDI	Config::JFDI is an implementation of Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader that\nexists outside of Catalyst.\n\nEssentially, Config::JFDI will scan a directory for files matching a\ncertain name. If such a file is found which also matches an extension that\nConfig::Any can read, then the configuration from that file will be loaded.\n\nConfig::JFDI will also look for special files that end with a "_local"\nsuffix. Files with this special suffix will take precedence over any other\nexisting configuration file, if any. The precedence takes place by merging\nthe local configuration with the "standard" configuration via\nHash::Merge::Simple.\n\nFinally, you can override/modify the path search from outside your\napplication, by setting the [NAME]_CONFIG variable outside your application\n(where [NAME] is the uppercase version of what you passed to\nConfig::JFDI->new).
perl-Sys-MemInfo	This module return the total amount of free and used physical memory\nin bytes in totalmem and freemem variables.\n\nThis module has been tested on Linux 3.13.0, UnixWare 7.1.2, AIX5,\nOpenBSD 3.8, NetBSD 2.0.2, FreBSD 5.4, HPUX11, Solaris 9, Tru64 5.1,\nIrix 6.5, MacOS X 10.2 and Windows XP.\n\nIt should work on FreeBSD 4 and Windows 9X/ME/NT/200X/Vista.
perl-Net-IPv4Addr	Net::IPv4Addr provides functions for parsing IPv4 addresses both in\ntraditional address/netmask format and in the new CIDR format. There\nare also methods for calculating the network and broadcast address\nand also to see check if a given address is in a specific network.
perl-Devel-Caller	Meatier version of the core caller.
perl-JSON-MaybeXS	This module first checks to see if either Cpanel::JSON::XS or JSON::XS is\nalready loaded, in which case it uses that module. Otherwise it tries to\nload Cpanel::JSON::XS, then JSON::XS, then JSON::PP in order, and either\nuses the first module it finds or throws an error.\n\nIt then exports the encode_json and decode_json functions from the loaded\nmodule, along with a JSON constant that returns the class name for calling\nnew on.
perl-Text-Soundex	Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English. The goal is for names with the same pronunciation to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. Soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms and is often used (incorrectly) as a synonym for "phonetic algorithm". Improvements to Soundex are the basis for many modern phonetic algorithms. (Wikipedia, 2007)/n/nThis module implements the original soundex algorithm developed by Robert Russell and Margaret Odell, patented in 1918 and 1922, as well as a variation called "American Soundex" used for US census data, and current maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
perl-Math-Symbolic	Math::Symbolic is intended to offer symbolic calculation capabilities to\nthe Perl programmer without using external (and commercial) libraries\nand/or applications.

perl-Unicode-String	A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of Unicode characters.\nMethods are provided to convert between various external formats\n(encodings) and Unicode::String objects, and methods are provided for\ncommon string manipulations.\n\nThe functions utf32be(), utf32le(), utf16be(), utf16le(), utf8(), utf7(),\nlatin1(), uhex(), uchr() can be imported from the Unicode::String module\nand will work as constructors initializing strings of the corresponding\nencoding.\n\nThe Unicode::String objects overload various operators, which means that\nthey in most cases can be treated like plain strings.
perl-Algorithm-Diff	This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two strings, or any other two lists of things.  It uses an intelligent algorithm similar to (or identical to) the one used by the Unix "diff" program.  It is guaranteed to find the *smallest possible* set of differences.

It can follow redirects, supports proxies, and automatically limits the number of connections to the values specified in the RFC.
perl-File-ReadBackwards	This module reads a file backwards line by line. It is simple to use,\nmemory efficient and fast. It supports both an object and a tied handle\ninterface.\n\nIt is intended for processing log and other similar text files which\ntypically have their newest entries appended to them. By default files\nare assumed to be plain text and have a line ending appropriate to the OS.\nBut you can set the input record separator string on a per file basis.

It implements asynchronous notifications that enable you to signal running perl code from another thread, asynchronously, and sometimes even without using a single syscall.
perl-Canary-Stability	This module is used by Schmorp's modules during configuration stage to test the installed perl for compatibility with his modules.
perl-Class-Accessor	This module automagically generates accessors/mutators for your class.
perl-common-sense	This module implements some sane defaults for Perl programs, as defined by two typical (or not so typical - use your common sense) specimens of Perl coders. In fact, after working out details on which warnings and strict modes to enable and make fatal, we found that we (and our code written so far, and others) fully agree on every option, even though we never used warnings before, so it seems this module indeed reflects a "common" sense among some long-time Perl coders.

This module provides a pure-perl implementation of nCk, nCRk, nPk, nPRk, !n and n! (combination, multiset, permutation, string, derangement, and factorial, respectively).
perl-Math-Random	Math::Random is a Perl port of the C version of randlib, which is a suite of routines for generating random deviates.
perl-Number-Compare	This module compiles a simple comparison to an anonymous subroutine, which you can call with a value to be tested again. The target value may use magnitudes of kilobytes (k, ki), megabytes (m, mi), or gigabytes (g, gi). Those suffixed with an i use the appropriate 2**n version in accordance with the IEC standard: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html
perl-Pod-Abstract	This module provides a means to load a POD (or POD compatible) document without direct reference to it's syntax, and perform manipulations on the abstract syntax tree.
perl-Pod-Coverage	Developers hate writing documentation. They'd hate it even more if their computer tattled on them, but maybe they'll be even more thankful in the long run. Even if not, perlmodstyle tells you to, so you must obey. This module provides a mechanism for determining if the pod for a given module is comprehensive.
perl-Tie-ToObject	While "tie" in perldoc allows tying to an arbitrary object, the class in question must support this in it's implementation of TIEHASH, TIEARRAY or whatever. This class provides a very tie constructor that simply returns the object it was given as it's first argument; this way side effects of calling $object->TIEHASH are avoided.
perl-Algorithm-Munkres	This module is a perl extension for Munkres' solution to classical Assignment problem for square and rectangular matrices. This module extends the solution of Assignment problem for square matrices to rectangular matrices by padding zeros. Thus a rectangular matrix is converted to square matrix by padding necessary zeros.

perl-Algorithm-LatticePoints	Lattice-point handling is a common chore. You do it for image processing, 3-d processing, and more. Usually you do it via nested for loops but it is boring and tedious. This module loops for you instead.
perl-Quantum-Superpositions	The Quantum::Superpositions module adds two new operators to Perl: any and all. Each of these operators takes a list of values (states) and superimposes them into a single scalar value (a superposition), which can then be stored in a standard scalar variable.
perl-HTML-Element-Extended	HTML-Element-Extended is a package of several enhanced HTML::Element classes, most of which arose during the effort to implement an HTML::Element based table class.

perl-Algorithm-Metric-Chessboard	Calculates the minimum number of moves between two points in a game played on a square grid, where one move is a jump from a point to a horizontal, vertical or diagonal neighbour.  However within the space are "wormholes" which allow you to travel between any two distant points, so the actual number of moves may be smaller than the above. Wormhole travel costs a fixed number of moves.
perl-Algorithm-RectanglesContainingDot	Given a set of rectangles and a set of dots, the algorithm implemented in this modules finds for every dot, which rectangles contain it. The algorithm complexity is O(R * log(R) * log(R) + D * log(R)) being R the number of rectangles and D the number of dots.
perl-Algorithm-WordLevelStatistics	This module implements the word level statistics algorithm as described in: P. Carpena, P. Bernaola-Galav, M. Hackenberg, A.V. Coronado and J.L. Oliver, "Level statistics of words: finding keywords in literary texts and DNA", Physical Review E 79, 035102-4 ( DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.79.035102 )
perl-Algorithm-BreakOverlappingRectangles	This module breaks overlapping rectangles into non overlapping ones.
perl-Algorithm-RectanglesContainingDot_XS	This module implements the same algorithm as Algorithm::RectanglesContainingDot in C/XS and so it is much faster (around 30 times faster!). The Algorithm::RectanglesContainingDot module will use this implementation automatically when available.
