vdirsyncer	Synchronize calendars and contacts.\n\nVdirsyncer synchronizes your calendars and addressbooks between two storages. The most popular purpose is to synchronize CalDAV and CardDAV with a local folder or file.\n\nThe local data can then be accessed via a variety of programs, none of which have to know or worry about syncing to a server.
acme-tiny	This is a tiny, auditable script that you can throw on your server to issue and renew Let's Encrypt certificates. Since it has to be run on your server and have access to your private Let's Encrypt account key, I tried to make it as tiny as possible (currently less than 200 lines).
