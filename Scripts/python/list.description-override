Mako	Mako Templates for Python\nMako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar,\nnon-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance.\nMako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others,\nincluding Django and Jinja2 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi.\nConceptually, Mako is an embedded Python (i.e. Python Server Page)\nlanguage, which refines the familiar ideas of componentized layout and\ninheritance to produce one of the most straightforward and flexible\nmodels available, while also maintaining close ties to Python calling\nand scoping semantics.

flask-cors	A Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making\ncross-origin AJAX possible.\nThis package has a simple philosophy: when you want to enable CORS, you\nwish to enable it for all use cases on a domain. This means no mucking\naround with different allowed headers, methods, etc.\nBy default, submission of cookies across domains is disabled due to the\nsecurity implications. Please see the documentation for how to enable\ncredentialed requests, and please make sure you add some sort of CSRF\nprotection before doing so!

junos-eznc	Junos PyEZ is a Python library to remotely manage/automate Junos devices. The user is NOT required: (a) to be a "Software Programmer", (b) have sophisticated knowledge of Junos, or (b) have a complex understanding of the Junos XML API.\n\nThis library was built for two types of users:\n\nFor "Non-Programmers" - Python as a Power Shell\nThis means that "non-programmers", for example the Network Engineer, can use the native Python shell on their management server (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.) as their point-of-control for remotely managing Junos devices. The Python shell is an interactive environment that provides the necessary means to perform common automation tasks, such as conditional testing, for-loops, macros, and templates. These building blocks are similar enough to other "shell" environments, like Bash, to enable the non-programmer to use the Python shell as a power-tool, rather than a programming language. From the Python shell a user can manage Junos devices using native hash tables, arrays, etc. rather than device-specific Junos XML or resorting to 'screen scraping' the actual Junos CLI.\n\nFor "Programmers" - Open and Extensible\nThere is a growing interest and need to automate the network infrastructure into larger IT systems. To do so, traditional software programmers, DevOps, "hackers", etc. need an abstraction library of code to further those activities. Junos PyEZ is designed for extensibility so that the programmer can quickly and easily add new widgets to the library in support of their specific project requirements. There is no need to "wait on the vendor" to provide new functionality. Junos PyEZ is not specifically tied to any version of Junos or any Junos product family.
vdirsyncer	Synchronize calendars and contacts.\n\nVdirsyncer synchronizes your calendars and addressbooks between two storages.

netbox-lists	NetBox Lists generates list of IPs and prefixes from NetBox data. While this can be accomplished using the existing NetBox API, this plugin saves the user from having to manipulate the data to get just the IPs/prefixes. Lists endpoints (mostly) share the same filters as the builtin NetBox endpoints, making querying easy.\n\nLists are returned as JSON arrays or as plain text. This means that firewalls can use NetBox as a source for dynamic address lists, such as Palo Alto's External Dynamic Lists, Fortinet's External Block List (Threat Feed) or pfSesnse/OPNSense's firewall aliases.\n\nThis plugin also features endpoints for devices/VMs compatible with Prometheus' http_sd.

Apart from the C code seldom changing, and\ntaking a long time to compile for all platforms, this allows installation\nof the .so on Linux systems under /usr/lib64/pythonX.Y (without a .pth\nfile or a ruamel directory) and the Python code for ruamel.yaml under\n/usr/lib/pythonX.Y.
