The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with
traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries
that can be used to build them. The name "LLVM" itself is not an
acronym; it is the full name of the project.

This package contains the dynamic clang libraries which are potentially
dependencies for ports that require clang to build.
