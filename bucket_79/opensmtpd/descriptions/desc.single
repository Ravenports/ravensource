OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the server-side SMTP protocol as
defined by RFC 5321, with some additional standard extensions. It allows
ordinary machines to exchange emails with other systems speaking the SMTP
protocol.

Started out of dissatisfaction with other implementations, OpenSMTPD is a
fairly complete SMTP implementation.
