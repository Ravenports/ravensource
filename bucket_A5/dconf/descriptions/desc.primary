Dconf is a simple key-based low-level configuration system. Its main 
purpose is to provide a backend to GSettings on platforms that don't 
already have configuration storage systems. Keys exist in an unstructured 
database. Dconf supports features like change notification, stacking of 
multiple configuration sources and mandatory keys.
