This package allows to access CP/M file systems similar to the well-known 
mtools package, which accesses MSDOS file systems. Currently it contains:

* cpmls - list sorted directory with output similar to ls, DIR, P2DOS DIR 
and CP/M3 DIR[FULL]
* cpmcp - copy files from and to CP/M file systems
* cpmrm - erase files from CP/M file systems
* cpmchmod - change file permissions
* cpmchattr - change file attributes
* mkfs.cpm - make a CP/M file system
* fsck.cpm - check and repair a CP/M file system (only simple errors can 
be repaired so far). Some images of broken file systems are provided for 
testing.
* fsed.cpm - view CP/M file system
* manual pages for everything including the CP/M file system format

All CP/M file system features are supported. Password protection is 
ignored, because passwords are easy to decrypt, but a pseudo file [passwd] 
contains them, if you are curious what your old password has been. The 
disk label is read as special file [label]. User numbers are specified as 
user:file. 

NOTE: This package does not currently ship the 'fsed.cpm' program.
