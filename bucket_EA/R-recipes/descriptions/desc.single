recipes: Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Steps for Modeling

A recipe prepares your data for modeling. We provide an extensible
framework for pipeable sequences of feature engineering steps provides
preprocessing tools to be applied to data. Statistical parameters for the
steps can be estimated from an initial data set and then applied to other
data sets. The resulting processed output can then be used as inputs for
statistical or machine learning models.
