ruamel.yaml
===========

``ruamel.yaml`` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

:version:       0.15.80
:updated:       2018-11-26
:documentation: http://yaml.readthedocs.io
:repository:    https://bitbucket.org/ruamel/
:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/


Starting with version 0.15.0 the way YAML files are loaded and dumped
is changing. See the API doc for details.  Currently existing
functionality will throw a warning before being changed/removed.
**For production systems you should pin the version being used with
``ruamel.yaml<=0.15``**. There might be bug fixes in the 0.14 series,
but new functionality is likely only to be available via the new API.

If your package uses ``ruamel.yaml`` and is not listed on PyPI, drop
me an email, preferably with some information on how you use the
package (or a link to bitbucket/github) and I'll keep you informed
when the status of the API is stable enough to make the transition.
