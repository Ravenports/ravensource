LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program supporting a number of
network protocols (ftp, http, sftp, fish, torrent). Like BASH, it has job
control and uses the readline library for input. It has bookmarks, a
built-in mirror command, and can transfer several files in parallel. It was
designed with reliability in mind. LFTP is free software, distributed under
the GNU GPL license.
