Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim
(which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation
and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very
clever -- but none are Vim.

Neovim strives to be a superset of Vim except for some intentionally
removed misfeatures. It is built for users who want the good parts of
Vim, and more.
