Soup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation in C.

It provides a queued asynchronous callback-based mechanism for sending and 
servicing SOAP requests, and a WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) for 
C compilers which generates client stubs and server skeletons for easily 
calling and implementing SOAP methods.  It uses GLib and is designed to 
work well with GTK applications.
