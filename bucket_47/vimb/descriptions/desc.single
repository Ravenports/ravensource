Vimb is a fast and lightweight vim like web browser based on the webkit
web browser engine and the GTK toolkit. Vimb is modal like the great vim
editor and also easily configurable during runtime. Vimb is mostly
keyboard driven and does not detract you from your daily work.

If your are familiar with vim or have some experience with pentadactyl the
use of vimb would be a breeze, if not we missed our target.
