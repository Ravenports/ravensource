libmesode is a fork of libstrophe for use in Profanity.

From http://strophe.im/libstrophe/:
libstrophe is a minimal XMPP library written in C. It has almost no
external dependencies, only an XML parsing library (expat or libxml
are both supported). It is designed for both POSIX and Windows
systems.
