## Quickstart

```sh
pip install 'pwdlib[argon2]'
`

`py
from pwdlib import PasswordHash

password_hash = PasswordHash.recommended()
hash = password_hash.hash("herminetincture")
password_hash.verify("herminetincture", hash)  # True
```

## Why `pwdlib`?

For years, the de-facto standard to hash passwords was [`passlib`].
Unfortunately, it has not been very active recently and its [maintenance
status is under question]. Starting Python 3.13, `passlib` won't work
anymore.

That's why I decided to start `pwdlib`, a password hash helper for the
modern Python era. However, it's **not designed to be a complete
replacement** for `passlib`, which supports numerous [hashing algorithms
and features].

**✅ Goals**

- [x] Provide an easy-to-use wrapper to hash and verify passwords
- [x] Support modern and secure algorithms like Argon2 or Bcrypt

**❌ Non-goals**

- [] Support legacy hashing algorithms like MD5
- [] Implement algorithms directly — we should only rely on existing and
battle-tested implementations

## Development

### Setup environment

We use [uv] to manage the development environment and production build, and
[just] to manage command shortcuts. Ensure they are installed on your
system.

### Run unit tests

You can run all the tests with:

`bash
just test
`

### Format the code

Execute the following command to apply linting and check typing:

`bash
hatch run lint
`

### Publish a new version

You can bump the version, create a commit and associated tag with one
command:

`bash
hatch version patch
`

`bash
hatch version minor
`

`bash
hatch version major
`

Your default Git text editor will open so you can add information about the
release.
