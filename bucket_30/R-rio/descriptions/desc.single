rio: A Swiss-Army Knife for Data I/O

Streamlined data import and export by making assumptions that the user is
probably willing to make: 'import()' and 'export()' determine the data
format from the file extension, reasonable defaults are used for data
import and export, web-based import is natively supported (including from
SSL/HTTPS), compressed files can be read directly, and fast import packages
are used where appropriate. An additional convenience function,
'convert()', provides a simple method for converting between file types.
