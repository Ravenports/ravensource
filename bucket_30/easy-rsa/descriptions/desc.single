Easy-rsa is a CLI utility to build and manage a PKI CA. In laymen's terms, 
this means to create a root certificate authority, and request and sign 
certificates, including sub-CAs and certificate revocation lists (CRL).

It's intended to be used for OpenVPN from where it originates but it is 
not limited to that - the script can create certificates e.g. for web 
usage, too. Once part of OpenVPN, Easy-RSA was split from it to become a 
separate project before the 2.3 release of the former.
