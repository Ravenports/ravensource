JSON-GLib is a library providing serialization and deserialization support 
for the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format described by RFC 4627.

It is a C library based on GLib and provides parser and a generator 
GObject classes as well as various wrappers for the complex data types 
employed by JSON (such as arrays and objects). To do so it uses GLib 
native data types and the generic value container GValue for ease of 
development. It also provides integration with the GObject classes for 
direct serialization into, and deserialization from, JSON data streams.
