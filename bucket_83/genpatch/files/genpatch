# Usage: genpatch newfile
#        genpatch oldfile newfile
#
# Will output a patch ready for dports (unified diff).
# If only newfile is given, oldfile is assumed as newfile.intermediate (1st)
# or newfile.orig (2nd) if such a file exists
# If the physical path doesn't start with /usr/obj/raven or /construction,
# genpatch sends output to stdout, otherwise, the patch file will be
# created in the current directory with a filename on the file's
# location relative to worksource.  The patch will be generated from
# wrksrc location.

# Ensure we always use the same timezone to avoid spurious metadata diffs
