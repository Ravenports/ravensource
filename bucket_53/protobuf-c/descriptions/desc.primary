This is protobuf-c, a C implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers data
serialization format. It includes libprotobuf-c, a pure C library that
implements protobuf encoding and decoding, and protoc-c, a code generator
that converts Protocol Buffer .proto files to C descriptor code, based on
the original protoc. protobuf-c formerly included an RPC implementation;
that code has been split out into the protobuf-c-rpc project.
