[Latest PyPI version]

Bootstrap 3 for Django.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to seamlessly blend Django and Bootstrap 3.

## Maintenance Mode

Bootstrap 3 has been superseded by Bootstrap 4, which has since been
superseded by Bootstrap 5. As a result, this package is now in
**maintenance mode** and will only receive bug fixes and security updates.
No new features or enhancements will be added. We recommend that new
projects use Bootstrap 5 and encourage existing projects to consider
migrating when feasible.

For Bootstrap 4, please refer to our dedicated package:
[django-bootstrap4].

For Bootstrap 5, please refer to our dedicated package:
[django-bootstrap5].

For icons, we recommend our dedicated package: [django-icons].

## Requirements

This package requires a combination of Python and Django that is currently
supported.
