magrittr: A Forward-Pipe Operator for R

Provides a mechanism for chaining commands with a new forward-pipe
operator, %&gt;%. This operator will forward a value, or the result of an
expression, into the next function call/expression. There is flexible
support for the type of right-hand side expressions. For more information,
see package vignette. To quote Rene Magritte, "Ceci n'est pas un pipe."
