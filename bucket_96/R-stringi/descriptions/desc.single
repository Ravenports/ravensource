stringi: Character String Processing Facilities

A collection of character string/text/natural language processing tools for
pattern searching (e.g., with 'Java'-like regular expressions or the
'Unicode' collation algorithm), random string generation, case mapping,
string transliteration, concatenation, sorting, padding, wrapping, Unicode
normalisation, date-time formatting and parsing, and many more. They are
fast, consistent, convenient, and - thanks to 'ICU' (International
Components for Unicode) - portable across all locales and platforms.
