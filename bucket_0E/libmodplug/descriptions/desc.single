Olivier Lapicque, author of Modplug, which is arguably the best quality 
MOD-playing software available, has placed his sound rendering code in the 
public domain.  This library and plugin is based on that code.

This code was originally part of modplug-xmms, and was split into a 
library - libmodplug and the modplug-xmms code.
