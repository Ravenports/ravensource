:Abstract: Docutils is a modular system for processing documentation into
           useful formats, such as HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
           For input Docutils supports reStructuredText, an easy-to-read,
           what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax.

Quick-Start
===========

This is for those who want to get up & running quickly.

1. Docutils requires **Python**, available from
   https://www.python.org/.
   See Dependencies_ below for details.

2. Install the latest stable release from PyPi with pip_::

       pip install docutils

   For alternatives and details, see section `Installation`_ below.

3. Use the `front-end scripts`_ to convert reStructuredText documents.
   Try for example::

       docutils FAQ.rst FAQ.html

   See Usage_ below for details.

Purpose
=======

The purpose of the Docutils project is to provide a set of tools for
processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML,
LaTeX, troff (man pages), OpenOffice, and native XML.  Support for the
following sources has been implemented:

* Standalone files.

* `PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_.

Support for the following sources is planned or provided by
`third party tools`_:

* Inline documentation from Python modules and packages, extracted
  with namespace context.

* Email (RFC-822 headers, quoted excerpts, signatures, MIME parts).

* Wikis, with global reference lookups of "wiki links".

* Compound documents, such as multiple chapter files merged into a
  book.

* And others as discovered.

.. _PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals):
   https://peps.python.org/pep-0012
.. _third party tools: docs/user/links.html#related-applications

Dependencies
============

To run the code, Python_ must be installed.
(Python is pre-installed with most Linux distributions.)

* Since version 0.21, Docutils requires Python 3.9 or later.
* Docutils versions 0.19 to 0.20.1 require Python 3.7 or later.
* Docutils versions 0.16 to 0.18 require Python 2.7 or 3.5+.

The **type hints** added in version 0.22 use Python 3.10 syntax.
However, the Python interpreter treats them as annotations
unless ``typing.TYPE_CHECKING is set to True``.

Recommendations
---------------

Docutils uses the following packages for enhanced functionality, if they
are installed:

* The recommended installer is pip_, setuptools_ works, too.

* The `Python Imaging Library`_ (PIL) is used for some image
  manipulation operations.

* The `Pygments`_ package provides syntax highlight of "code" directives
  and roles.
