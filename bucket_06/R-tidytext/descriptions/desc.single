tidytext: Text Mining using 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and Other Tidy Tools

Using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more
effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use. Much of the
infrastructure needed for text mining with tidy data frames already exists
in packages like 'dplyr', 'broom', 'tidyr', and 'ggplot2'. In this package,
we provide functions and supporting data sets to allow conversion of text
to and from tidy formats, and to switch seamlessly between tidy tools and
existing text mining packages.
