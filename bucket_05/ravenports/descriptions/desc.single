This is a metapackage to install a turnkey Ravenports system.

This package installs a system root and toolchain tailored to the host
platform.  It then ensures that ravensw(8) is available on the host, and
finally it installs the ravenadm administration tool.  At this point the
user can use ravenadm to install the latest Ravenports conspiracy (ports
tree consisting of buildsheets) and start building packages.
