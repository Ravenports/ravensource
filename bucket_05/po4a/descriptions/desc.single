The po4a (po for anything) project goal is to ease translations
(and more interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using
gettext tools in areas where they were not expected, like
documentation.

po4a supports currently the following formats:
 * manpages
 * pod
 * xml (generic, docbook, xhtml, dia, or guide)
 * sgml
 * TeX (generic, LaTeX, or Texinfo)
 * text (simple text files with some formatting)
 * ini
 * KernelHelp
