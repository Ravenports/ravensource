LLD is a linker from the LLVM project. That is a drop-in replacement for
system linkers and runs much faster than them. It also provides features
that are useful for toolchain developers.

The linker supports ELF (Unix), PE/COFF (Windows), Mach-O (macOS) and
WebAssembly in descending order of completeness.
